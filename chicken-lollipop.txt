Ingredients

    6 chicken wings-cut off one bone and collect all the flesh at one end
    1 egg-slightly beaten
    1 cup cornstarch/cornflour
    1 tsp garlic paste
    1 tsp ginger paste
    1 tsp salt
    Oil for deep-frying

Method

1. Mix together the chicken, egg, cornflour, garlic and ginger paste, 1 tsp salt and enough water so that the chicken pieces are 'coated' with the batter. 2. Leave thus for about an hour.
3. Heat the oil and deep-fry the chicken wings over high heat to begin with and then lower the heat till wings are almost cooked through.
4. Drain on absorbent paper.
5. Just before serving, heat the oil again and fry the wings in hot oil till brown, drain on absorbent paper and serve.
